		<h2>Kelsey M. Brickel</h2><br>
		<p>24 years young | Proud Mom | Ambitious Student and Soldier</p>
		
		<p>I am a passionate Web Developer, trying to improve my programming skills. I hope to one day open a marketing company of my own, and my hopes are so high I already bought the domain name. I never thought I would be able to create things like this, and I'm so excited to continue in this degree and learn as much as I possibly can. </p>

			<h2>Parallax Effect</h2>
			<img src="images/Parallax%20Effect.png" alt="Parallax Effect">
			<h3>What I hope to practice and learn: </h3>
			
			<p>I hope to learn how to make this a regular section on my pages. Although I think some pages use it too much, I think a small section like was used on this site would be great. I want to practice putting it in different spots, and learn what the best uses for it would be as far as design.</p>
			
			<h3>How I feel this relates to what I've learned throughout this degree:</h3>
			
			<p>I learned how to make pages in general responsive thus far but I have not learned how to create this 3D effect. I found that most of this is animation, and probably javascript which is something I struggle with and need to spend a lot more time on. </p>
			
			<h3>How I might build this:</h3>
			
			<p>
				1. Creat component as a div nested inside a section<br>
				2. Place an image inside of the section using CSS<br>
				3. Using CSS
				4. Possibly add some text fading

            <p>I have used very few effects so this will be great practice to learn how to use create these effects</p>

			<h3>What I hope to practice and learn:</h3>
			
			<p>I hope to learn how to create beautiful and responsive CTA's that don't overwhelm my content, and don't take too long to load.</p>
			<h3>How I feel this relates to what I've learned throughout this degree:</h3>
			
			<p>I have made a few decent CTA's but none with a responsive image, so this will help me learn how to do that.</p>

			<h2>Drop Down Menu Header</h2>
			<img src="images/drop_down_menu_header.png" alt="Drop Down Menu Header" >
			<h3>What I hope to practice and learn: </h3>
				
			<p>I want to learn how to do this without using a framework. I struggle most with javascript and debugging the errors, so I hope to increase my knowledge and skills with that.</p>
			
			<h3>How I feel this relates to what I've learned throughout this degree:</h3>
			<p> I tried in a previous class, but for some reason I couldn't get it to work and I ran out of time on the project to ask extensive questions about why I couldn't get my javascript to work.</p>

			<h3>What I hope to practice and learn:</h3>
			
			<p>I hope to learn how to create an image carousel without using frameworks like Bootstrap or Skeleton</p>
			
			<h3>How I feel this relates to what I've learned throughout this degree:</h3>
			
			<p>When I have created image carousel's previously it has always been with a framework. I want to sharpen my skills so that I'm able to create them from scratch.</p>
